# Wireless Sensor Network Simulation Projects

This repository contains documentation, analysis, and reports for three simulation projects focused on designing, modeling, and optimizing Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) for energy efficiency and network lifetime. The projects were completed as part of the **Wireless Sensor Networks and IoT (CIE 510)** course.

## Project Overview

The projects involve the theoretical analysis and simulation design of a WSN, with a focus on energy consumption modeling, network lifetime optimization, and the impact of different transmission strategies and sink node placements. Each project builds upon the previous one, introducing new complexities and optimization techniques.

### Key Features:
- **Energy Consumption Modeling**: Theoretical analysis of energy usage in sensor nodes for transmission, reception, and data processing.
- **Network Lifetime Optimization**: Design of clustering algorithms, dual-hop transmission, and cluster head rotation strategies to extend network lifetime.
- **Sink Node Placement**: Evaluation of the impact of sink node location on network performance.
- **Simulation Design**: Conceptual design of MATLAB-based simulations to study the effects of various parameters on network behavior.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three folders, each corresponding to a project simulation:

### 1. **Project Simulation 1**
- **Objective**: Analyze network lifetime using direct transmission.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Theoretical modeling of a WSN with 100 sensor nodes randomly distributed in a 100m x 100m area.
  - Analysis of network lifetime with the sink node at the center and corner.
  - Documentation of energy consumption and node death over cycles.

### 2. **Project Simulation 2**
- **Objective**: Extend the WSN model by introducing dual-hop transmission and intermediate relay nodes.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Theoretical implementation of dual-hop transmission for nodes beyond a certain radius.
  - Optimization of the transmission radius to maximize network lifetime.
  - Comparison of network performance with the sink node at different locations.

### 3. **Project Simulation 3**
- **Objective**: Optimize network lifetime using clustering and cluster head rotation.
- **Key Tasks**:
  - Design of cluster head election and rotation strategies every `C` cycles.
  - Analysis of the impact of cluster head rotation on network lifetime.
  - Comparison of clustering strategies with fixed cluster head nodes.

## How to Use

This repository contains **project reports, analysis, and documentation** rather than executable code. Each folder includes detailed explanations of the simulation design, theoretical models, and results.

1. **Navigate to the Project Folder**:
   - Each project folder contains a detailed report (in PDF format) outlining the simulation design, assumptions, and analysis.
   - Open the reports to understand the theoretical framework and findings.

2. **Review the Analysis**:
   - The reports include observations, graphs, and conclusions based on the theoretical models.
   - Use the insights to understand the impact of different parameters on network performance.

## Results and Observations

- **Project 1**: Demonstrated the impact of sink node placement on network lifetime, with the center placement outperforming the corner placement.
- **Project 2**: Showed that dual-hop transmission significantly improves network lifetime, especially for nodes far from the sink.
- **Project 3**: Cluster head rotation was found to balance energy consumption across nodes, further extending network lifetime.
